This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Name

rjsplayground - lightway of learning different react.js concepts.

## Description

Project to learn and experiment with React features.  
- Starting with jsx and moving on to TypeScript.
- Started with create-react-app via npx and moving on to vercel.
- API calls to the backend (mainly ASP.NET WebApi) via Axios and moving on/extending to SWR library.  
- Experimenting with different strategies for component decomposition.
- Component development.
- Bootstrap or Tailwind.
- Managing the state. From props to passing down the top context api.smtp.com up until advanced liberal like Redux.
- Next step, NetNinja. Get familiar with react outside of npx create-react-app.
- I had a moment of realization today at work. I noticed I don't have fully understand component state using a combination of useState, useEffect and swr/fetcher.
Planning to spend sometime to work on custom views that contain a composition of components that can depend on some state before/and/or after calls to external/different API endpoints.
- Types vs interfaces in React.js app.
- useFormik, simple dropdown and Read/Editing mode form to submit data to the backend  
  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
